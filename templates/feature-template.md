## Summary
[summary]: #summary

> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Detailed design
[detailed-design]: #detailed-design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with Cake to 
understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. 
This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of 
how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this
[how-we-teach-this]: #how-we-teach-this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Cake guides must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how Cake is taught to new users
at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing Cake
users?

## Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this?

## Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
